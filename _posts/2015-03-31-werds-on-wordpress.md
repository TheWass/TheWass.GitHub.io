My one thought was to get the material that I had already written out on the internet as quickly as possible.  Previously, I had all these posts on a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) based web server with limited public access.  I decided to migrate the content to a WordPress-based web server since I have some experience working with WordPress plugins.  WordPress.com provides a hosted web server to easily host and quickly create content.  Hindsight: this may not have been the best decision.

WordPress.com is a service provided by Automattic which provides a hosted web server for users to quickly stand up a website, create blog material, and post it on the Internet.  The upside of this is it is fast and easy, particularly for non-technical users, to create and share content.  The free version is very basic, and does not include very many customization features.  I gotta pay WordPress.com for the privilege of adding in my own CSS.

WordPress.org on the other hand contains the source code and documentation for the free and open source WordPress framework.  WordPress is actually quite venerable and has been around for a long time.  As with any framework, I have my quarrels with it, but by and large, it is well documented, and fairly simple to extend.

This is the WordPress I want.  Once I get the time, I'll begin migrating the content from werdsofthewass.wordpress.com to some other hosting service.  That way I can leverage the full power of the WordPress framework, and not the limited, suffocated version that WordPress.com offers (at least, for free).
