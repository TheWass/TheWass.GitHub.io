Ok, so you're thinking, "Waitaminute, I'm already a software engineer!
Why do I need an introduction for something I've been doing for months/years??"
Believe me, I get it. I was thinking the same thing when I began the course.
But have you sat down and really thought about what software engineering actually means?

Let's start with a dumb question:

## What is programming?

Wikipedia:

>  "Programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a
>  computing problem to executable programs."

That's a pretty boring definition. That's like saying sculpting is a process
that leads from a mental image to a physical object.  
Programming is so much more than just translating a computing problem to code.
It's a purely creative process. Very much like artwork. Each programmer codes
in his or her own way. Our code can be just as beautiful as a Michelangelo sculpture.
The poet writes, the singer sings, the artist paints, the programmer codes.

The difference? When a painter paints a mistake, they can paint around it, and still make it beautiful. The singer can embellish a mistake. When a programmer makes an error, the program dies. Artists can cheat. Programmers cannot. We must be perfect. People will be using and depending on what we write, and we depend on other programs to make ours work.

Case in point: Debian 5.0: has around [324 million lines of code.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code#Example) That's ridiculous!
Assuming 50 lines per page, there are 6.5 million pages. That stack of pages would be taller than a 30 floor building!
Assuming 5 words per line at 50 words per minute, it would take one person 61 years to write!
Oh, and that code has to work.

In order to take our sculpture and transform it into an architecture, we need to engineer our code.

Here's a second dumb question:

## What is software engineering?

Wikipedia (complete with another boring definition):

>  "Software engineering is the study and application of engineering to the design,
>  development, and maintenance of software."

My Software Engineering instructor put it quite succinctly:

>  "Software Engineering is the process of taking something that is an innately creative,
>  abstract, and imperfect activity and engineer it into a craft where we build large-scale,
>  real systems that people depend on."

Software Engineering offers a way to manage the software complexity,
much more than just writing modules and programming using object oriented techniques.  
There are four stages to manage software complexity:

1.  Have an engineering process that gives developers a structure to work and communicate.
    - Software development life cycles
2. Define rules that govern whether software is considered correct.
    - Requirements engineering
3. Specify the design of software using formalisms to verify that our software is correct.
    - Software specification and design
4. Rigorously test the software system for bugs.
    - Software verification

In the next couple of posts, I will be covering the second stage, requirements engineering.
