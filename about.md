In my humble opinion, knowledge should be freely available to all those who have the desire and drive to learn.  I post to discuss, enlighten, and teach others about various things that I have learned over the years.

Now, I realize this is the internet.  I can post anything I darn well please, and people might just believe whatever outlandish things I have to say.  Establishing credibility on the internet is a rather Herculean task, and I applaud those who have done so.

With that in mind,  My name is Alex Wasser, but everyone calls me Wass.  I have a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Engineering from Wright State University.  I have worked in tech support for about 5.5 years and as a web developer for 1.5 and counting.  My mission is to post on topics and ideas that I have thought about and learned something with the goal of enlightening others. 
Welcome to Werds of The Wass.
