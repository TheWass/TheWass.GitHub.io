After doing a good amount of research, I have decided to move Werds of the Wass off of WerdPress.com and to [GitHub.io](https://pages.github.com/).  (BTW, did you know that GitHub can host websites??)  The website will be [https://TheWass.GitHub.io](https://TheWass.GitHub.io).  I'm working on theming  it right now, so there's not much there.

The advantage for having GitHub host the website is updating the website is exactly like committing to GitHub.  Plus, all of my code (and thus, the website) will be versioned.

The disadvantage to GitHub is the server cannot be modified.  It only serves pages; it cannot process PHP, Python, or any other server side code.

Despite the disadvantages, there are tools which can create a very functional website using only non-server code.  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby program which creates a static site out of markdown content.  [Disqus](https://disqus.com/websites/) is a service which provides a space for comments.

Have a GitHub account and want to set up your own?  Go to [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) and follow the instructions.
