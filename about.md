In my humble opinion, knowledge should be freely available to all those who have the desire and drive to learn.  I post to discuss, enlighten, and teach others about various things that I have learned over the years.

Now, I realize this is the internet.  I can post anything I darn well please, and people might just believe whatever outlandish things I have to say.  Establishing credibility without divulging identity on the internet is a rather Herculean task.  I applaud those who have done so, particularly in a scientific world, where  credentials are inexorably linked with identity.  On the internet, credibility is an asset, but identification is a liability.

With that in mind,  My name is The Wass.  Everyone calls me that.  Sometimes just Wass, but it's all the same.  I have a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Engineering from Wright State University.  I have worked in tech support for about 5.5 years and as a software engineer for 1 and counting.  My mission is to post on topics and ideas that I have thought about and learned something with the goal of enlightening others. 
Welcome to Werds of The Wass.
